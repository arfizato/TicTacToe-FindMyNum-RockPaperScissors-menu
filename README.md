# TicTacToe-FindMyNum-RockPaperScissors-menu
This is an interface i'm working on trying to learn more about working with classes and working on a project with different files while also linking my past three python projects together :) 

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PILLOW INSTALLED IF YOU RUN INTO AN ERROR WITH THE PIP MODULE (to install it go to  https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-photoimage/ )

any feedback given is appreciated and will be taken in consideration. this originally started as homework but it turned out quite fun

Hope you Like it :)
